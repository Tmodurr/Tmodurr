- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tmodurr
- 👀 I’m interested in all things spatial, frontend and middleware development, process automation, and being creative mixing IT w/ personal interests (music, gardening, etc)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about modern auth patterns, state management systems, and integrated serverless patterns into geospatial solutions
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on spatial/development projects and topics that doesn't necessarily relate to my day job :smile:
